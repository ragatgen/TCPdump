Explanation:
tcpdump --snapshot-length=0 -vvv -w "$OUTPUT_FILE": This command starts tcpdump capturing with the following options:
--snapshot-length=0: Capture the entire packet without truncation.
-vvv: Increase verbosity level for more detailed output.
-w "$OUTPUT_FILE": Write output to the specified file (capture.cap in this case).
Notes:
Adjust OUTPUT_FILE to point to the actual path where you want to save the tcpdump capture file (capture.cap).
Ensure that you have permissions to write to the specified directory and execute tcpdump with the desired options.
The script checks the file size periodically (sleep 300 seconds, or every 5 minutes) and rotates the file (mv and restarts tcpdump) when it exceeds MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES.
Customize MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES to fit your specific size requirement (5 GB in this example).
